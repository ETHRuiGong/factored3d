## Demo and Pre-trained Models

Please check out the [interactive notebook](demo/demo.ipynb) which shows reconstructions using the learned models. To run this, you'll first need to follow the [installation instructions](docs/Installation.md) to download trained models and some pre-requisites.

## Training and Evaluating
To train or evaluate the (trained/downloaded) models, it is first required to [download the SUNCG dataset](docs/suncg_data.md) and [preprocess the data](docs/preprocessing.md). Please see the detailed README files for [Training](docs/training.md) or [Evaluation](docs/evaluation.md) of models for subsequent instructions.
